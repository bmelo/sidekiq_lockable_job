# SidekiqLockableJob

Prevent a job to run until another one complete.

[Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) includes a jobs dependencies mechanism to prevent a job from running before another one when enqueued.

But sometime your jobs will be enqueued independently, then for you do not know the job id on which you depend on (you could parse Sidekiq queue, but...)

`SidekiqLockableJob` allows you to set some locks ( based on job params ) when a job is enqueued or processed (store in redis), to prevent any other jobs to run if locked ( based on job params ) and will unlock any previously set locks ( based on job params ) when a job is **succesfully** completed.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq_lockable_job'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sidekiq_lockable_job

## Usage

The gem is compose of four parts:

- Setting locks when job is **enqueued**
- Setting locks when job is **processed**
- Raising `LockableJob::LockedJobError` when job **start** to processed but is locked
- Unsetting locks when job is **succesfully** processed

### Setting locks when job is **enqueued**

> happens in the sidekiq client middleware (on you rails app)
> including `Sidekiq::LockableJob` auto set the middleware chain

```ruby
class Worker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  include Sidekiq::LockableJob

  def self.lockable_job_client_lock_keys(args)
    # jobs args are always in an array like **args
    lock_key = args.first['a_key']
    "some_context_prefix:#{lock_key}"
  end

  def perform
  end
end
```

When your job is **ENQUEUED** (`Worker.perform_async`), sidekiq LockableJob client middleware, will call `lockable_job_client_lock_keys` (before enqueuing the job) with the jobs arguments and set a lock for any returned keys

### Setting locks when job is processed

> happens in the sidekiq server middleware (on you rails worker)
> including `Sidekiq::LockableJob` auto set the middleware chain

```ruby
class Worker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  include Sidekiq::LockableJob

  def self.lockable_job_server_lock_keys(args)
    # jobs args are always in an array like **args
    lock_key = args.first['a_key']
    "some_context_prefix:#{lock_key}"
  end

  def perform
  end
end
```

When your job is **PROCESSED**, sidekiq LockableJob server middleware, will call `lockable_job_client_lock_keys` (before running the job) with the jobs arguments and set a lock for any returned keys

### Raising `LockableJob::LockedJobError` when job start to processed but is locked

> happens in the sidekiq server middleware (on you rails worker)
> including `Sidekiq::LockableJob` auto set the middleware chain

```ruby
class Worker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  include Sidekiq::LockableJob

  def self.lockable_job_locked_by_keys(args)
    # jobs args are always in an array like **args
    lock_key = args.first['a_key']
    "some_context_prefix:#{lock_key}"
  end

  def perform
  end
end
```

When your job is **about** to be **processed**, sidekiq LockableJob server middleware, will call `lockable_job_locked_by_keys` (before processing the job) with the jobs arguments and raise `Sidekiq::LockableJob::LockedJobError` if any of the returned keys is locked

### Unsetting locks when job is **succesfully** processed

> happens in the sidekiq server middleware (on you rails worker)
> including `Sidekiq::LockableJob` auto set the middleware chain

```ruby
class Worker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  include Sidekiq::LockableJob

  def self.lockable_job_unlock_keys(args)
    # jobs args are always in an array like **args
    lock_key = args.first['a_key']
    "some_context_prefix:#{lock_key}"
  end

  def perform
  end
end
```

When your job is **successfully** to be **performed**, sidekiq LockableJob server middleware, will call `lockable_job_unlock_keys` (after processing the job) with the jobs arguments and unset lock for any returned keys

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
